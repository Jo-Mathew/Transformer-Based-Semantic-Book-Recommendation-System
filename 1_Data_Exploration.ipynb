As such, he gathered hard, corroborated intelligence on Argentine intentions over the Falklands - which the British establishment then chose to ignore. The reasons behind this British decision, and its disastrous and inevitable consequences in the South Atlantic, are the main story of this book. There were three main players in the war, each of them trying to overcome their own cultural baggage. The Argentines were riddled with guilt: after years of fighting a morally repugnant campaign against its own people, the Argentine military saw a war for the Malvinas islands as a perfect opportunity to win back their self-respect. The hands of the Americans were also bloody from the likewise dirty wars they had sponsored and abetted in Central America. For Britain it was simply the last straw after decades of humiliation.\",\n          \"Detective Sergeant Lloyd Hopkins of the LAPD, fueled by a desire to protect innocence, confronts a murderer who is driven by the same forces when he investigates a series of murders of young women in the Los Angeles area.

In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset is now cleaned!"],"metadata":{"id":"mh-W77KMFR6m"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Saving the cleaned csv"],"metadata":{"id":"nRU-FmS9FP1A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["(\n","    book_missing_25_words\n","    .drop([\"subtitle\", \"missing_description\", \"age_of_book\", \"words_in_description\"], axis=1)\n","    .to_csv(\"books_cleaned.csv\", index = False)\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"AyN6ChuNDyAS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750569276330,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":122,"user":{"displayName":"JomyMary Mathew","userId":"01202227901626941766"}}},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[]}]}
