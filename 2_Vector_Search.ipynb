In The Vampyre (1819), John Polidori introduced Lord Ruthven and established the vampire craze of the 19th century that resulted in a flood of German vampire poetry, French vampire drama, and British vampire fiction. That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.\",\n          \"9780020442608 The \\\"Dawn Treader\\\" is the first ship Narnia has seen in centuries.

John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n","\n","persist_dir = \"./chroma_db_minilm\"\n","\n","db_books = Chroma.from_documents(\n","    documents,\n","    embedding=embeddings,\n","    persist_directory=persist_dir\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Fe2ue_iZSpbc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750573685574,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":447749,"user":{"displayName":"JomyMary Mathew","userId":"01202227901626941766"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["persist_dir = \"./chroma_db_minilm\"\n","\n","db_books = Chroma(\n","    embedding_function=embeddings,\n","    persist_directory=persist_dir\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bJM6uEGfTB-D"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Test query\n","query = \"A book to teach children about nature\""],"metadata":{"id":"MrUT2lb8PN_Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750573912010,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":46,"user":{"displayName":"JomyMary Mathew","userId":"01202227901626941766"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["docs = db_books.similarity_search(query, k=10)"],"metadata":{"id":"bVrkKzdfQz1P","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750573913034,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"JomyMary Mathew","userId":"01202227901626941766"}}},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["docs"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gAL7fXx_Q8Y6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1750573913951,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"JomyMary Mathew","userId":"01202227901626941766"}},"outputId":"1a0c8fa2-ee50-4368-c611-b5d436d8e208"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[Document(id='0d249698-0220-4ce7-8738-18ad7a5908f9', metadata={'source': 'tagged_description.txt'}, page_content='9780786808069 Children will discover the exciting world of their own backyard in this introduction to familiar animals from cats and dogs to bugs and frogs.
